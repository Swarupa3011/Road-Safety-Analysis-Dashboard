The Road Safety Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization project developed using Power BI, aimed at analyzing and presenting insights from road traffic accident datasets. This interactive dashboard allows users to explore accident patterns, identify high-risk locations, observe time-based and seasonal trends, and examine contributing factors such as weather conditions and road environments. Designed to support traffic authorities, urban planners, and policymakers, the dashboard offers dynamic filters and intuitive visuals that enable data-driven decision-making to enhance road safety and reduce accident rates. The project utilizes structured data from CSV/Excel sources and employs Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, ensuring accuracy and clarity in the visual output. By converting complex data into actionable insights, the dashboard serves as a valuable tool for strategic planning, infrastructure development, and public safety initiatives.
